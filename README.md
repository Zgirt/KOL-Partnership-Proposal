**Available Options:**<br>


-Option 0: **No, I don’t want**<br>
-Option 1: **Yes, approve the KOL Budget proposal. Payout 150.00 bn**<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Objective:
We wish to leverage the influence of a top-tier Key Opinion Leader (KOL) and supporting KOLs from the Nebula agency to enhance Qubic’s visibility and growth through consistent, high-impact marketing on X (Twitter) and YouTube over a three-month period.

## Overview of the Proposal:
The primary KOL, supported by the Nebula agency, will post at least once per week on X and YouTube about Qubic. These posts will highlight Qubic’s unique value proposition, ongoing developments, and future potential.

In return, the KOLs will receive:
- $50,000 USDT per month.
- $100,000 worth of Qubic tokens per month, subject to a three-month vesting schedule for each allocation.

### Payment Schedule (not exact dates):
- **12th Jan** - $50K USDT with $100K in Qubic at 12th Jan prices - vested until 12 April
- **12th Feb** - $50K USDT with $100K in Qubic at 12th Feb prices - vested until 12 May
- **12th March** - $50K USDT with $100K in Qubic at 12th March prices vested until 12th June. 

## KOL Metrics and Reach:

### X (Twitter):
- Basic posts for the Nebula KOL achieve over 100,000 impressions, with some exceeding 1 million impressions (before retail amplification).

### YouTube (YT):
- **Views:** 1,963,275
- **Total Watch Time:** 364,662.97 hours
- **Average Views per Video:** 46,744.64
- **Total Impressions:** 17,168,443
- **Average Impressions per Video:** 408,772.45
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** 7.52%

### Additional Reach:
- The Nebula KOL has a private Discord community of 3,000 members, who will be informed 48 hours before public content is posted.
- These metrics ensure the campaign will deliver significant exposure to Qubic across multiple channels.

## Why This KOL and Agency?
- The KOL independently identified Qubic as a project of interest, based on their research team’s analysis. Their proactive engagement reflects the alignment between their audience and Qubic’s target demographic and from there discussions with Nebula took place.

### Why not free promotion?
- As the saying goes: "If you are good at something, never do it for free." However, the KOL, via Nebula, has agreed to a 100% vesting schedule for Qubic tokens, marking the first time they have not required 20% upfront payment, showcasing their commitment to Qubic’s success.

## Financial Details:
- **Monthly Payment:** $50,000 USDT and $100,000 in $QUBIC (vested for three months).
- **Total Qubic Allocation:** 150 billion Qubic tokens over three months.

From this allocation:
- Only $50,000 worth of Qubic will be sold upon release, with a further $50,000 sold each month, with the $QUBIC vested.
- Coins not utilized will be given to the ecosystem fund (will discuss with Alber to which is best) but this money must be used on expedited projects, i.e., projects that will be finished in 2-4 months so our ecosystem grows.

## Expected ROI:
This campaign aims to:
- Achieve millions of impressions per month across X and YT.
- Drive traffic to Qubic’s website and social platforms, with a projected increase in community growth by 20–30%.

Our aim is to grow Qubic’s visibility and adoption to potentially align with projects in the top tier of CoinMarketCap. This statement is aspirational and not a guarantee of performance.

## Milestones for Evaluation:
- **End of Month 1:** Review campaign performance metrics (impressions, views, engagement). Contract written with exit clause here if metrics are not met.
- **End of Month 2:** Adjust strategy based on ROI and community feedback.
- **End of Month 3:** Comprehensive evaluation and decision on renewal or further collaboration.

## Risk Mitigation:

### Performance Monitoring:
- Monthly reviews to ensure the KOL meets engagement targets.
- Flexibility to adjust strategy if metrics fall below expectations.

### $QUBIC Vesting:
- Vesting ensures the KOL remains committed to Qubic’s long-term success.

### Community Safeguards:
- Unused Qubic coins from the KOL CCF request will be given to the ecosystem fund (will discuss with Alber to which is best) but this money must be used on expedited projects, i.e., projects that will be finished in 2-4 months so our ecosystem grows.

## Addressing Concerns About Marketing vs. Development:

### Marketing and Development Work Hand-in-Hand:
- Even the best products need visibility to attract users.
- This campaign will create the attention necessary to onboard early adopters, who will explore and engage with Qubic’s products.

### Building Momentum for Product Launches:
- Marketing ensures a ready audience for future product launches, accelerating adoption and providing valuable feedback.

### Strategic Focus:
- The KOL will focus on educating their audience about Qubic’s products, use cases, and vision, creating informed and engaged users rather than fleeting attention.

### Development as a Priority:
- Qubic remains committed to building innovative products and use cases.
- This campaign is a complementary effort to boost visibility without diverting significant resources from development.

## Conclusion:
This partnership with a proven and highly influential Nebula KOL offers an unparalleled opportunity to elevate Qubic’s market presence. With their vested interest, robust reach, and alignment with Qubic’s mission, we believe this campaign represents a prudent investment in Qubic’s future growth.

We request approval to allocate 150bn $QUBIC for this campaign.
